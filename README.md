Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning classification algorithms. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, specific resampling techniques were applied to improve model performance on the minority class (fraud cases).

Key Highlights
‚úÖ Class Imbalance Addressed:
Used resampling techniques such as Random Oversampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset and enhance model performance.

ü§ñ Algorithms Implemented:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

üèÜ Best Performing Model:
Random Forest Classifier, which achieved:

Accuracy: 0.99

F1-Score: 0.80

AUC Score: 0.96

Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of resampling techniques and comparative model evaluation for fraud detection. The Random Forest model proved to be the most effective in balancing precision and recall while maintaining high overall accuracy.
